          <h2>Advantages of Zirconia Dental Crowns</h2>
          <div>
            <p>
              Zirconia crowns resemble your teeth in most instances. Though they cannot be bleached or whitened
              after fitting, the crowns don’t lose their original color due to staining.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Durability</li>
              <li>Strength</li>
              <li>Comfort</li>
              <li>Color</li>
              <li>Biocompatibility</li>
              <li>Aesthetic </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              The ceramic crown can cause additional wear and tear in the teeth surrounding it. However, we know how
              to minimize this impact and ensure that all your teeth will be healthy and strong. The Zirconia tooth cap
              cost in Pune is affordable (and depends on the patient’s dental condition).
            </p>
